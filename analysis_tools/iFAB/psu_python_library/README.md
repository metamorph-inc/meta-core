===============

Conceptual model for cost and lead time.

## Regressions to check for after a change to the design representation:

* Failure to locate files:
  - design ADM
  - manufacturing models
  - component ACMs
  - hull STP model
* Failure to associate manufacturing models to components
* Over- or under-counting the hull plates in the hull cost model
