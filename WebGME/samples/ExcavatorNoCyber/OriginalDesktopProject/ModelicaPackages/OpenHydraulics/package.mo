<h4><font color=\"#008000\" size=5>The Modelica License 2</font></h4>
<p>
<strong>Preamble.</strong> The goal of this license is that Modelica related model libraries, software, images, documents, data files etc. can be used freely in the original or a modified form, in open source and in commercial environments (as long as the license conditions below are fulfilled, in particular sections 2c) and 2d). The Original Work is provided free of charge and the use is completely at your own risk. Developers of free Modelica packages are encouraged to utilize this license for their work. 
<p>
The Modelica License applies to any Original Work that contains the following licensing notice adjacent to the copyright notice(s) for this Original Work: 
<p>
<strong>Note.</strong> This is the standard Modelica License 2, except for the following changes: the parenthetical in paragraph 7., paragraph 5., and the addition of paragraph 15.d).

<h4>1. Definitions</h4>
<ol type=\"a\"><li>
\"License\" is this Modelica License.
</li><li>
\"Original Work\" is any work of authorship, including software, images, documents, data files, that contains the above licensing notice or that is packed together with a licensing notice referencing it. 
</li><li>
\"Licensor\" is the provider of the Original Work who has placed this licensing notice adjacent to the copyright notice(s) for the Original Work. The Original Work is either directly provided by the owner of the Original Work, or by a licensee of the owner. 
</li><li>
\"Derivative Work\" is any modification of the Original Work which represents, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the matter of clarity and as examples:
<ol type=\"A\">
<li>
Derivative Work shall not include work that remains separable from the Original Work, as well as merely extracting a part of the Original Work without modifying it. 
</li><li>
Derivative Work shall not include (a) fixing of errors and/or (b) adding vendor specific Modelica annotations and/or (c) using a subset of the classes of a Modelica package, and/or (d) using a different representation, e.g., a binary representation. 
</li><li>
Derivative Work shall include classes that are copied from the Original Work where declarations, equations or the documentation are modified. 
</li><li>
Derivative Work shall include executables to simulate the models that are generated by a Modelica translator based on the Original Work (of a Modelica package). </li>
</ol>
</li>
<li>
\"Modified Work\" is any modification of the Original Work with the following exceptions: (a) fixing of errors and/or (b) adding vendor specific Modelica annotations and/or (c) using a subset of the classes of a Modelica package, and/or (d) using a different representation, e.g., a binary representation. 
</li><li>
\"Source Code\" means the preferred form of the Original Work for making modifications to it and all available documentation describing how to modify the Original Work. 
</li><li>
\"You\" means an individual or a legal entity exercising rights under, and complying with all of the terms of, this License. 
</li><li>
\"Modelica package\" means any Modelica library that is defined with the
 <b>package</b> &lt;Name&gt; ... <b>end</b> &lt;Name&gt;<b>;</b> Modelica language element.
</li>
</ol>
 
<h4>2. Grant of Copyright License</h4>
<p>
Licensor grants You a worldwide, royalty-free, non-exclusive, sublicensable license, for the duration of the copyright, to do the following: 
<ol type=\"a\">
<li>
To reproduce the Original Work in copies, either alone or as part of a collection. 
</li><li>
To create Derivative Works according to Section 1d) of this License. 
</li><li>
To distribute or communicate to the public copies of the <u>Original Work</u> or a <u>Derivative Work</u> under <u>this License</u>. No fee, neither as a copyright-license fee, nor as a selling fee for the copy as such may be charged under this License. Furthermore, a verbatim copy of this License must be included in any copy of the Original Work or a Derivative Work under this License. 
<br>
For the matter of clarity, it is permitted A) to distribute or communicate such copies as part of a (possible commercial) collection where other parts are provided under different licenses and a license fee is charged for the other parts only and B) to charge for mere printing and shipping costs. 
</li><li>
To distribute or communicate to the public copies of a <u>Derivative Work</u>, alternatively to Section 2c), under <u>any other license</u> of your choice, especially also under a license for commercial/proprietary software, as long as You comply with Sections 3, 4 and 8 below. 
<br>
For the matter of clarity, no restrictions regarding fees, either as to a copyright-license fee or as to a selling fee for the copy as such apply. 
</li><li>
To perform the Original Work publicly. 
</li><li>
To display the Original Work publicly. 
</li></ol><p>
<h4>3. Acceptance</h4>
<p>
Any use of the Original Work or a Derivative Work, or any action according to either Section 2a) to 2f) above constitutes Your acceptance of this License. 
<p>
<h4>4. Designation of Derivative Works and of Modified Works</h4>
 
<p>
The identifying designation of Derivative Work and of Modified Work must be different to the corresponding identifying designation of the Original Work. This means especially that the (root-level) name of a Modelica package under this license must be changed if the package is modified (besides fixing of errors, adding vendor specific Modelica annotations, using a subset of the classes of a Modelica package, or using another representation, e.g. a binary representation). <p>
 
<h4>5. [reserved]</h4>
<p>
<h4>6. Provision of Source Code</h4>
<p>Licensor agrees to provide You with a copy of the Source Code of the Original Work but reserves the right to decide freely on the manner of how the Original Work is provided. For the matter of clarity, Licensor might provide only a binary representation of the Original Work. In that case, You may (a) either reproduce the Source Code from the binary representation if this is possible (e.g., by performing a copy of an encrypted Modelica package, if encryption allows the copy operation) or (b) request the Source Code from the Licensor who will provide it to You. 
<p>
<h4>7. Exclusions from License Grant</h4>
<p>
Neither the names of Licensor (including, but not limited to, University of California, Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, U.S. Dept. of Energy, UC, LBNL, LBL, and DOE), nor the names of any contributors to the Original Work, nor any of their trademarks or service marks, may be used to endorse or promote products derived from this Original Work without express prior permission of the Licensor. Except as otherwise expressly stated in this License and in particular in Sections 2 and 5, nothing in this License grants any license to Licensor's trademarks, copyrights, patents, trade secrets or any other intellectual property, and no patent license is granted to make, use, sell, offer for sale, have made, or import embodiments of any patent claims. 
<p>
No license is granted to the trademarks of Licensor even if such trademarks are included in the Original Work, except as expressly stated in this License. Nothing in this License shall be interpreted to prohibit Licensor from licensing under terms different from this License any Original Work that Licensor otherwise would have a right to license. 
<p>
<h4>8. Attribution Rights</h4>
<p>
You must retain in the Source Code of the Original Work and of any Derivative Works that You create, all author, copyright, patent, or trademark notices, as well as any descriptive text identified therein as an \"Attribution Notice\". The same applies to the licensing notice of this License in the Original Work. For the matter of clarity, \"author notice\" means the notice that identifies the original author(s). 
<p>
You must cause the Source Code for any Derivative Works that You create to carry a prominent Attribution Notice reasonably calculated to inform recipients that You have modified the Original Work. 
<p>In case the Original Work or Derivative Work is not provided in Source Code, the Attribution Notices shall be appropriately displayed, e.g., in the documentation of the Derivative Work. <p>
 
<h4>9. Disclaimer of Warranty</h4>
<p><u><strong>The Original Work is provided under this License on an \"as is\" basis and without warranty, either express or implied, including, without limitation, the warranties of non-infringement, merchantability or fitness for a particular purpose. The entire risk as to the quality of the Original Work is with You.</strong></u> This disclaimer of warranty constitutes an essential part of this License. No license to the Original Work is granted by this License except under this disclaimer. 
<p>
<h4>10. Limitation of Liability</h4>
<p>Under no circumstances and under no legal theory, whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise, shall the Licensor, the owner or a licensee of the Original Work be liable to anyone for any direct, indirect, general, special, incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a result of this License or the use of the Original Work including, without limitation, damages for loss of goodwill, work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all other commercial damages or losses. This limitation of liability shall not apply to the extent applicable law prohibits such limitation. 
<p>
<h4>11. Termination</h4>
<p>
This License conditions your rights to undertake the activities listed in Section 2 and 5, including your right to create Derivative Works based upon the Original Work, and doing so without observing these terms and conditions is prohibited by copyright law and international treaty. Nothing in this License is intended to affect copyright exceptions and limitations. This License shall terminate immediately and You may no longer exercise any of the rights granted to You by this License upon your failure to observe the conditions of this license. 
<p>
<h4>12. Termination for Patent Action</h4>
<p>
This License shall terminate automatically and You may no longer exercise any of the rights granted to You by this License as of the date You commence an action, including a cross-claim or counterclaim, against Licensor, any owners of the Original Work or any licensee alleging that the Original Work infringes a patent. This termination provision shall not apply for an action alleging patent infringement through combinations of the Original Work under combination with other software or hardware.
<p>
<h4>13. Jurisdiction</h4>
<p>
Any action or suit relating to this License may be brought only in the courts of a jurisdiction wherein the Licensor resides and under the laws of that jurisdiction excluding its conflict-of-law provisions. The application of the United Nations Convention on Contracts for the International Sale of Goods is expressly excluded. Any use of the Original Work outside the scope of this License or after its termination shall be subject to the requirements and penalties of copyright or patent law in the appropriate jurisdiction. This section shall survive the termination of this License. 
<p>
<h4>14. Attorneys' Fees</h4>
<p>
In any action to enforce the terms of this License or seeking damages relating thereto, the prevailing party shall be entitled to recover its costs and expenses, including, without limitation, reasonable attorneys' fees and costs incurred in connection with such action, including any appeal of such action. This section shall survive the termination of this License. 
<p>
<h4>15. Miscellaneous</h4>
<ol type=\"a\">
<li>If any provision of this License is held to be unenforceable, such provision shall be reformed only to the extent necessary to make it enforceable. 
</li><li>
No verbal ancillary agreements have been made. Changes and additions to this License must appear in writing to be valid. This also applies to changing the clause pertaining to written form. 
</li><li>
You may use the Original Work in all ways not otherwise restricted or conditioned by this License or by law, and Licensor promises not to interfere with or be responsible for such uses by You. 
</li><li>
You are under no obligation whatsoever to provide any bug fixes, patches, or upgrades to the features, functionality or performance of the source code (\"Enhancements\") to anyone; however, if you choose to make your Enhancements available either publicly, or directly to Lawrence Berkeley National Laboratory, without imposing a separate written license agreement for such Enhancements, then you hereby grant the following license: a non-exclusive, royalty-free perpetual license to install, use, modify, prepare derivative works, incorporate into other computer software, distribute, and sublicense such enhancements or derivative works thereof, in binary and source code form.

This component defines the complete regime of wall friction.
The details are described in the
<a href=\"Modelica://Modelica_Fluid.UsersGuide.ComponentDefinition.WallFriction\">UsersGuide</a>.
The functional relationship of the friction loss factor &lambda; is
displayed in the next figure. Function massFlowRate_dp() defines the \"red curve\"
(\"Swamee and Jain\"), where as function pressureLoss_m_flow() defines the
\"blue curve\" (\"Colebrook-White\"). The two functions are inverses from 
each other and give slightly different results in the transition region
between Re = 1500 .. 4000, in order to get explicit equations without
solving a non-linear equation.

     \"zeta2\" depending on the flow direction.<br>
     When the Reynolds number Re is below \"Re_turbulent\", the
     flow is laminar for small flow velocities. For higher 
     velocities there is a transition region from 
     laminar to turbulent flow. The loss factor for
     laminar flow at small velocities is defined by the often occuring
     approximation c0/Re. If c0 is different for the two
     flow directions, the mean value has to be used 
     (c0 = (c0_ab + c0_ba)/2).<li>
<li> The equation \"&Delta;p = 0.5*&zeta;*&rho;*v*|v|\" is either with
     respect to port_a or to port_b, depending on the definition
     of the particular loss factor &zeta; (in some references loss
     factors are defined with respect to port_a, in other references
     with respect to port_b).</li>
 
<li> Re = |v|*D_Re*&rho;/&eta; = |m_flow|*D_Re/(A_Re*&eta;) 
     is the Reynolds number at the smallest cross
     section area. This is often at port_a or at port_b, but can
     also be between the two ports. In the record, the diameter
     D_Re of this smallest cross section area has to be provided, as
     well, as Re_turbulent, the absolute value of the 
     Reynolds number at which
     the turbulent flow starts. If Re_turbulent is different for
     the two flow directions, use the smaller value as Re_turbulent.</li>
<li> D is the diameter of the pipe. If the pipe has not a 
     circular cross section, D = 4*A/P, where A is the cross section
     area and P is the wetted perimeter.</li>
<li> A is the cross section area with A = &pi;(D/2)^2.
<li> &eta; is the dynamic viscosity.</li>
</ul>
<p>
The laminar and the transition region is usually of
not much technical interest because the operating point is
mostly in the turbulent regime. For simplification and for
numercial reasons, this whole region is described by two
polynomials of third order, one polynomial for m_flow &ge; 0 
and one for m_flow &lt; 0. The polynomials start at 
Re = |m_flow|*4/(&pi;*D_Re*&eta;), where D_Re is the
smallest diameter between port_a and port_b.
The common derivative
of the two polynomials at Re = 0 is
computed from the equation \"c0/Re\". Note, the pressure drop
equation above in the laminar region is always defined
with respect to the smallest diameter D_Re.
</p>
<p>
If no data for c0 is available, the derivative at Re = 0 is computed in such
a way, that the second derivatives of the two polynomials
are identical at Re = 0. The polynomials are constructed, such that
they smoothly touch the characteristic curves in the turbulent
regions. The whole characteristic is therefore <b>continuous</b>
and has a <b>finite</b>, <b>continuous first derivative everywhere</b>.
In some cases, the constructed polynomials would \"vibrate\". This is 
avoided by reducing the derivative at Re=0 in such a way that
the polynomials are guaranteed to be monotonically increasing.
The used sufficient criteria for monotonicity follows from:

  This model is the simplest implementation for a splitting/joining component for
  N flows. Its use is not required. It just formulates the balance
  equations in the same way that the connect symmantics would formulate them anyways.
  The main advantage of using this component is, that the user does not get
  confused when looking at the specific enthalpy at each port which might be confusing
  when not using a splitting/joining component. The reason for the confusion is that one exmanins the mixing
  enthalpy of the infinitesimal control volume introduced with the connect statement when
  looking at the specific enthalpy in the connector which
  might not be equal to the specific enthalpy at the port in the \"real world\".</html>"));

(one in the region -x_small .. 0 and one within the region 0 .. x_small)
such that

<ul>
<li> The derivative at x=0 is non-zero (in order that the
     inverse of the function does not have an infinite derivative). </li>
<li> The overall function is continuous with a
     continuous first derivative everywhere.</li>
<li> If parameter use_yd0 = <b>false</b>, the two polynomials
     are constructed such that the second derivatives at x=0
     are identical. If use_yd0 = <b>true</b>, the derivative
     at x=0 is explicitly provided via the additional argument
     yd0. If necessary, the derivative yd0 is automatically 
     reduced in order that the polynomials are strict monotonically  
     increasing <i>[Fritsch and Carlson, 1980]</i>.</li>
