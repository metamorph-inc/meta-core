## GME 16.3+
[Download it here](https://forge.isis.vanderbilt.edu/gme)

GME_x64 is the best-tested (but 32-bit should work too)

## UDM x64 3.2.14+
[Download it here](http://repo.isis.vanderbilt.edu/UDM/3.2.14/)

## Windows Updates
Again, install Windows updates until everything is current. Restart your computer.

## Clone Repo
Clone this repository to your disk.

# Build
1. Open Visual Studio Command Prompt (2015 or 2017) with ”Run as administrator”. (Do not use a Visual Studio x64 command prompt)
2. From the root repository directory, run `make_all_without_installer.cmd`. This may take 30 minutes to build. _(Warnings may be ignored, but there should be no errors.)_

If you encounter errors, try to build once more. There may be some remaining race conditions in the build scripts.

# Installer
Run `bin\Python27\Scripts\python.exe deploy\build_msi.py` to build the installer.
