This file is a demo for the LibraryManager methods and
 demonstrates their usage. Many of the print statements
 are commented out, so that you can comment them back in

    """
    First, we need to create a LibraryManager object. We'll
     call it "library_manager" so that we know what it is. 
    The parameter passed to it is the location of the .json
     document.
    """
    
    library_manager = LibraryManager()
    

    """
    This class has a number of methods we'll demonstrate. The first
     method of importance is the materialData method, which takes as
     a parameter a string representing the name of the material for
     which you need data. 
    """
    
    steelData = library_manager.materialData("steel_stainless_316_l")
    
    """
    The steelData variable now contains all the data about the 
     steel_stainless_316_l material. As it stands, it isn't 
     incredibly useful to us. We need to iterate through the 
     data structure to extract the useful information.
    """
    #pprint(steelData)
    #pprint(steelData["density"])
    
    #This assumes list is only one level deep for compound properties
    for keys in steelData:
        unit = ""
        if "unit" in steelData[keys]:
            unit = steelData[keys]["unit"]
        #print keys + " = " + str(steelData[keys]["value"]) + " " + unit
            
        
    
    #In the current version, this will print all materials, even if 
    # the values are listed as "none"
    
    #In future versions, the properties with values of "None" will not 
    # be listed in the JSON. Currently, we display these properties 
    # because other functions rely upon it
    
    #===========================================================================
    # If you don't want to see values of "None," make a conditional statement
    #  to filter these out of your results:
    #===========================================================================
    for keys in steelData:
        unit = ""
        if "unit" in steelData[keys]:
            unit = steelData[keys]["unit"]
        if steelData[keys]["value"] != "None":
            pass
            #print keys + " = " + str(steelData[keys]["value"]) + " " + unit
        
    """
    Next, we demonstrate the listAllProperties() method. As you might
     expect, it produces a list of all the material properties an 
     object might possess.  
    """

    propList =  library_manager.listAllProperties()
    
    """
    Of course, since this is a list, we need to traverse it in order to
     access its data.
    """
    
    numProperties = 0
    for prop in propList:
        #print prop
        numProperties += 1
    #print numProperties
    
    """
    Finally, we have listAllMaterials(), which, as you might
     expect, lists all the materials in the library_manager
     by name. 
    """
    
    allMaterials =  library_manager.listAllMaterials()
    
    """
    As in the previous example, if you want to access
     the variables, you'll need to traverse the list.
    """
    
    for mat in allMaterials:
        pass
        #print mat
    
    print("Checking version number: ")
    version = library_manager.checkVersion(username, password)
    print("Version: " + str(version))
    library_manager.updateJSON(username, password)
    print("\nDone with the demo!")
