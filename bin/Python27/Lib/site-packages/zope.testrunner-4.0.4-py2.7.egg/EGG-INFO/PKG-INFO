        This package provides a flexible test runner with layer support.
        
        
        Getting started
        ***************
        
        zope.testrunner uses buildout.  To start, run ``python bootstrap.py``.  It will
        create a number of directories and the ``bin/buildout`` script.  Next, run
        ``bin/buildout``.  It will create a test script for you.  Now, run ``bin/test``
        to run the zope.testrunner test suite.

        4.0.4 (2011-10-25)
        ==================
        
        - Work around sporadic timing-related issues in the subprocess buffering
          tests.  Thanks to Jonathan Ballet for the patch!
        
        
        4.0.3 (2011-03-17)
        ==================
        
        - Added back support for Python <= 2.6 which was broken in 4.0.2.
        
        
        4.0.2 (2011-03-16)
        ==================
        
        - Added back Python 3 support which was broken in 4.0.1.
        
        - Fixed `Unexpected success`_ support by implementing the whole concept.
        
        - Added support for the new __pycache__ directories in Python 3.2.
        
        
        4.0.1 (2011-02-21)
        ==================
        
        - LP #719369: An `Unexpected success`_ (concept introduced in Python 2.7) is
          no longer handled as success but as failure. This is a workaround. The
          whole unexpected success concept might be implemented later.

          UTF8-encoded data.
        
        
        4.0.0b4 (2010-06-23)
        ====================
        
        - Package as a zipfile to work around Python 2.4 distutils bug (no
          feature changes or bugfixes in ``zope.testrunner`` itself).
        
        
        4.0.0b3 (2010-06-16)
        ====================
        
        - LP #221151: keep ``unittest.TestCase.shortDescription`` happy by supplying
          a ``_testMethodDoc`` attribute.
        
        - LP #595052: keep the distribution installable under Python 2.4:  its
          distutils appears to munge the empty ``__init__.py`` file in the
          ``foo.bar`` egg used for testing into a directory.
        
        - LP #580083: fix the ``bin/test`` script to run only tests from
          ``zope.testrunner``.
        
        - LP #579019: When layers were run in parallel, their tearDown was
          not called. Additionally, the first layer which was run in the main
          thread did not have it's tearDown called either.
        
        
        4.0.0b2 (2010-05-03)
        ====================
        
        - Having 'sampletests' in the MANIFEST.in gave warnings, but doesn't actually
          seem to include any more files, so I removed it.
        
        - Moved zope.testing.exceptions to zope.testrunner.exceptions. Now
          zope.testrunner no longer requires zope.testing except for when running
          its own tests.
        
        
        4.0.0b1 (2010-04-29)
        ====================
        
        - Initial release of the testrunner from zope.testrunner as it's own module.

        Test Runner
        ===========
        
        The testrunner module is used to run automated tests defined using the
        unittest framework.  Its primary feature is that it *finds* tests by
        searching directory trees.  It doesn't require the manual
        concatenation of specific test suites.  It is highly customizable and
        should be usable with any project.  In addition to finding and running
        tests, it provides the following additional features:
        
        - Test filtering using specifications of:
        
          o test packages within a larger tree
        
          o regular expression patterns for test modules
        
          o regular expression patterns for individual tests
        
        - Organization of tests into levels and layers
        
          Sometimes, tests take so long to run that you don't want to run them
          on every run of the test runner.  Tests can be defined at different
          levels.  The test runner can be configured to only run tests at a
          specific level or below by default.  Command-line options can be
          used to specify a minimum level to use for a specific run, or to run
          all tests.  Individual tests or test suites can specify their level
          via a 'level' attribute. where levels are integers increasing from 1.
        
          Most tests are unit tests.  They don't depend on other facilities, or
          set up whatever dependencies they have.  For larger applications,
          it's useful to specify common facilities that a large number of
          tests share.  Making each test set up and and tear down these
          facilities is both ineffecient and inconvenient.  For this reason,
          we've introduced the concept of layers, based on the idea of layered
          application architectures.  Software build for a layer should be
          able to depend on the facilities of lower layers already being set
          up.  For example, Zope defines a component architecture.  Much Zope
          software depends on that architecture.  We should be able to treat
          the component architecture as a layer that we set up once and reuse.
          Similarly, Zope application software should be able to depend on the
          Zope application server without having to set it up in each test.
        
          The test runner introduces test layers, which are objects that can
          set up environments for tests within the layers to use.  A layer is
          set up before running the tests in it.  Individual tests or test
          suites can define a layer by defining a `layer` attribute, which is
          a test layer.

        Simple Usage
        ============
        
        The test runner consists of an importable module.  The test runner is
        used by providing scripts that import and invoke the `run` method from
        the module.  The `testrunner` module is controlled via command-line
        options.  Test scripts supply base and default options by supplying a
        list of default command-line options that are processed before the
        user-supplied command-line options are provided.
        
        Typically, a test script does 2 things:
        
        - Adds the directory containing the zope package to the Python
          path.
        
        - Calls the test runner with default arguments and arguments supplied
          to the script.
        
          Normally, it just passes default/setup arguments.  The test runner
          uses `sys.argv` to get the user's input.
        
        This testrunner_ex subdirectory contains a number of sample packages
        with tests.  Let's run the tests found here. First though, we'll set
        up our default options:
        
            >>> import os.path
            >>> directory_with_tests = os.path.join(this_directory, 'testrunner-ex')
            >>> defaults = [
            ...     '--path', directory_with_tests,
            ...     '--tests-pattern', '^sampletestsf?$',
            ...     ]
        
        The default options are used by a script to customize the test runner
        for a particular application.  In this case, we use two options:
        
        path
          Set the path where the test runner should look for tests.  This path
          is also added to the Python path.
        
        tests-pattern
          Tell the test runner how to recognize modules or packages containing
          tests.
        
        Now, if we run the tests, without any other options:
        
            >>> from zope import testrunner
            >>> import sys
            >>> sys.argv = ['test']
            >>> testrunner.run_internal(defaults)
            Running samplelayers.Layer1 tests:

              Ran 156 tests with 0 failures and 0 errors in N.NNN seconds.
            Tearing down left over layers:
              Tear down zope.testrunner.layer.UnitTests in N.NNN seconds.
            Total: 321 tests, 0 failures, 0 errors in N.NNN seconds.
            False
        
        we see the normal testrunner output, which summarizes the tests run for
        each layer.  For each layer, we see what layers had to be torn down or
        set up to run the layer and we see the number of tests run, with
        results.
        
        The test runner returns a boolean indicating whether there were
        errors.  In this example, there were no errors, so it returned False.
        
        (Of course, the times shown in these examples are just examples.
        Times will vary depending on system speed.)
        
        Layers
        ======
        
        A Layer is an object providing setup and teardown methods used to setup
        and teardown the environment provided by the layer. It may also provide
        setup and teardown methods used to reset the environment provided by the
        layer between each test.
        
        Layers are generally implemented as classes using class methods.
        
        >>> class BaseLayer:
        ...     def setUp(cls):
        ...         log('BaseLayer.setUp')
        ...     setUp = classmethod(setUp)
        ...
        ...     def tearDown(cls):
        ...         log('BaseLayer.tearDown')
        ...     tearDown = classmethod(tearDown)
        ...
        ...     def testSetUp(cls):
        ...         log('BaseLayer.testSetUp')
        ...     testSetUp = classmethod(testSetUp)
        ...
        ...     def testTearDown(cls):
        ...         log('BaseLayer.testTearDown')
        ...     testTearDown = classmethod(testTearDown)
        ...
        
        Layers can extend other layers. Note that they do not explicitly
        invoke the setup and teardown methods of other layers - the test runner
        does this for us in order to minimize the number of invocations.
        
        >>> class TopLayer(BaseLayer):
        ...     def setUp(cls):
        ...         log('TopLayer.setUp')
        ...     setUp = classmethod(setUp)
        ...
        ...     def tearDown(cls):
        ...         log('TopLayer.tearDown')
        ...     tearDown = classmethod(tearDown)
        ...
        ...     def testSetUp(cls):
        ...         log('TopLayer.testSetUp')
        ...     testSetUp = classmethod(testSetUp)
        ...
        ...     def testTearDown(cls):
        ...         log('TopLayer.testTearDown')
        ...     testTearDown = classmethod(testTearDown)
        ...
        
        Tests or test suites specify what layer they need by storing a reference
        in the 'layer' attribute.
        
        >>> import unittest
        >>> class TestSpecifyingBaseLayer(unittest.TestCase):
        ...     'This TestCase explicitly specifies its layer'
        ...     layer = BaseLayer
        ...     name = 'TestSpecifyingBaseLayer' # For testing only
        ...
        ...     def setUp(self):
        ...         log('TestSpecifyingBaseLayer.setUp')
        ...
        ...     def tearDown(self):
        ...         log('TestSpecifyingBaseLayer.tearDown')
        ...
        ...     def test1(self):
        ...         log('TestSpecifyingBaseLayer.test1')
        ...
        ...     def test2(self):
        ...         log('TestSpecifyingBaseLayer.test2')
        ...
        >>> class TestSpecifyingNoLayer(unittest.TestCase):
        ...     'This TestCase specifies no layer'
        ...     name = 'TestSpecifyingNoLayer' # For testing only
        ...     def setUp(self):
        ...         log('TestSpecifyingNoLayer.setUp')
        ...
        ...     def tearDown(self):
        ...         log('TestSpecifyingNoLayer.tearDown')
        ...
        ...     def test1(self):
        ...         log('TestSpecifyingNoLayer.test')
        ...
        ...     def test2(self):
        ...         log('TestSpecifyingNoLayer.test')
        ...
        
        Create a TestSuite containing two test suites, one for each of
        TestSpecifyingBaseLayer and TestSpecifyingNoLayer.
        
        >>> umbrella_suite = unittest.TestSuite()
        >>> umbrella_suite.addTest(unittest.makeSuite(TestSpecifyingBaseLayer))
        >>> no_layer_suite = unittest.makeSuite(TestSpecifyingNoLayer)
        >>> umbrella_suite.addTest(no_layer_suite)
        
        Before we can run the tests, we need to setup some helpers.
        
        >>> from zope.testrunner import options
        >>> from zope.testing.loggingsupport import InstalledHandler
        >>> import logging
        >>> log_handler = InstalledHandler('zope.testrunner.tests')
        >>> def log(msg):
        ...     logging.getLogger('zope.testrunner.tests').info(msg)
        >>> def fresh_options():
        ...     opts = options.get_options(['--test-filter', '.*'])
        ...     opts.resume_layer = None
        ...     opts.resume_number = 0
        ...     return opts
        
        Now we run the tests. Note that the BaseLayer was not setup when
        the TestSpecifyingNoLayer was run and setup/torn down around the
        TestSpecifyingBaseLayer tests.
        
        >>> from zope.testrunner.runner import Runner
        >>> runner = Runner(options=fresh_options(), args=[], found_suites=[umbrella_suite])
        >>> succeeded = runner.run()
        Running ...BaseLayer tests:
          Set up ...BaseLayer in N.NNN seconds.
          Ran 2 tests with 0 failures and 0 errors in N.NNN seconds.
        Running zope.testrunner.layer.UnitTests tests:
          Tear down ...BaseLayer in N.NNN seconds.
          Set up zope.testrunner.layer.UnitTests in N.NNN seconds.
          Ran 2 tests with 0 failures and 0 errors in N.NNN seconds.
        Tearing down left over layers:
          Tear down zope.testrunner.layer.UnitTests in N.NNN seconds.
        Total: 4 tests, 0 failures, 0 errors in N.NNN seconds.
        
        
        Now lets specify a layer in the suite containing TestSpecifyingNoLayer
        and run the tests again. This demonstrates the other method of specifying
        a layer. This is generally how you specify what layer doctests need.
        
        >>> no_layer_suite.layer = BaseLayer
        >>> runner = Runner(options=fresh_options(), args=[], found_suites=[umbrella_suite])
        >>> succeeded = runner.run()
        Running ...BaseLayer tests:
          Set up ...BaseLayer in N.NNN seconds.
          Ran 4 tests with 0 failures and 0 errors in N.NNN seconds.
        Tearing down left over layers:
          Tear down ...BaseLayer in N.NNN seconds.
        
        Clear our logged output, as we want to inspect it shortly.
        
        >>> log_handler.clear()
        
        Now lets also specify a layer in the TestSpecifyingNoLayer class and rerun
        the tests. This demonstrates that the most specific layer is used. It also
        shows the behavior of nested layers - because TopLayer extends BaseLayer,
        both the BaseLayer and TopLayer environments are setup when the
        TestSpecifyingNoLayer tests are run.
        
        >>> TestSpecifyingNoLayer.layer = TopLayer
        >>> runner = Runner(options=fresh_options(), args=[], found_suites=[umbrella_suite])
        >>> succeeded = runner.run()
        Running ...BaseLayer tests:
          Set up ...BaseLayer in N.NNN seconds.
          Ran 2 tests with 0 failures and 0 errors in N.NNN seconds.
        Running ...TopLayer tests:
          Set up ...TopLayer in N.NNN seconds.
          Ran 2 tests with 0 failures and 0 errors in N.NNN seconds.
        Tearing down left over layers:
          Tear down ...TopLayer in N.NNN seconds.
          Tear down ...BaseLayer in N.NNN seconds.
        Total: 4 tests, 0 failures, 0 errors in N.NNN seconds.
        
        
        If we inspect our trace of what methods got called in what order, we can
        see that the layer setup and teardown methods only got called once. We can
        also see that the layer's test setup and teardown methods got called for
        each test using that layer in the right order.

        Now lets stack a few more layers to ensure that our setUp and tearDown

        Layer Selection
        ===============
        
        We can select which layers to run using the --layer option:

            False
        
        
        We can also specify that we want to run only the unit tests:

        Or that we want to run all of the tests except for the unit tests:
        
            >>> sys.argv = 'test -f'.split()
            >>> testrunner.run_internal(defaults)

            False
        
        Or we can explicitly say that we want both unit and non-unit tests.

        Passing arguments explicitly
        ============================
        
        In most of the examples here, we set up `sys.argv`.  In normal usage,
        the testrunner just uses `sys.argv`.  It is possible to pass arguments
        explicitly.
        
            >>> import os.path

        override.
        
        For example, --list-tests defaults to being turned off, but if we pass in a
        different default, that one takes effect.

        Normally, we just get a summary.  We can use the -v option to get
        increasingly more information.
        
        If we use a single --verbose (-v) option, we get a dot printed for each
        test:

        Sometimes, There are tests that you don't want to run by default.
        For example, you might have tests that take a long time.  Tests can
        have a level attribute.  If no level is specified, a level of 1 is
        assumed and, by default, only tests at level one are run.  to run
        tests at a higher level, use the --at-level (-a) option to specify a higher
        level.  For example, with the following options:
        
        
            >>> sys.argv = 'test -u  -vv -t test_y1 -t test_y0'.split()

        If -p or --progress have been previously provided on the command line (perhaps by a
        wrapper script) but you do not desire progress indication, you can switch it off with
        --no-progress:
        
            >>> sys.argv = 'test -u -t test_one.TestNotMuch -p --no-progress'.split()

        Debugging
        =========
        
        The testrunner module supports post-mortem debugging and debugging
        using `pdb.set_trace`.  Let's look first at using `pdb.set_trace`.
        To demonstrate this, we'll provide input via helper Input objects:
        
            >>> class Input:
            ...     def __init__(self, src):
            ...         self.lines = src.split('\n')
            ...     def readline(self):
            ...         line = self.lines.pop(0)
            ...         print line
            ...         return line+'\n'
        
        If a test or code called by a test calls pdb.set_trace, then the
        runner will enter pdb at that point:

        Note that, prior to Python 2.4, calling pdb.set_trace caused pdb to
        break in the pdb.set_trace function.  It was necessary to use 'next'
        or 'up' to get to the application code that called pdb.set_trace.  In
        Python 2.4, pdb.set_trace causes pdb to stop right after the call to
        pdb.set_trace.
        
        You can also do post-mortem debugging, using the --post-mortem (-D)
        option:

            >>> sys.argv = ('test -ssample3 --tests-pattern ^sampletests_d$'

        Layers that can't be torn down
        ==============================
        
        A layer can have a tearDown method that raises NotImplementedError.
        If this is the case and there are no remaining tests to run, the test
        runner will just note that the tear down couldn't be done:
        
            >>> import os.path, sys
            >>> directory_with_tests = os.path.join(this_directory, 'testrunner-ex')
            >>> from zope import testrunner
            >>> defaults = [
            ...     '--path', directory_with_tests,
            ...     '--tests-pattern', '^sampletestsf?$',
            ...     ]
        
            >>> sys.argv = 'test -ssample2 --tests-pattern sampletests_ntd$'.split()
            >>> testrunner.run_internal(defaults)
            Running sample2.sampletests_ntd.Layer tests:
              Set up sample2.sampletests_ntd.Layer in 0.000 seconds.
              Ran 1 tests with 0 failures and 0 errors in 0.000 seconds.

              Tear down sample2.sampletests_ntd.Layer ... not supported
            False
        
        If the tearDown method raises NotImplementedError and there are remaining
        layers to run, the test runner will restart itself as a new process,
        resuming tests where it left off:
        
            >>> sys.argv = [testrunner_script, '--tests-pattern', 'sampletests_ntd$']

        If you want to use pdb from a test in a layer that is run as a

        that it's not run as a subprocess.
        
        
        If a test is run in a subprocess and it generates output on stderr (as
        stderrtest does), the output is ignored (but it doesn't cause a SubprocessError
        like it once did).

        If the --coverage option is used, test coverage reports will be generated.  The
        directory name given as the parameter will be used to hold the reports.
        
        
            >>> import os.path, sys

        Ignoring Tests
        --------------
        
        The ``trace`` module supports ignoring directories and modules based the test
        selection. Only directories selected for testing should report coverage. The
        test runner provides a custom implementation of the relevant API.
        
        The ``TestIgnore`` class, the class managing the ignoring, is initialized by
        passing the command line options. It uses the options to determine the
        directories that should be covered.
        
          >>> class FauxOptions(object):
          ...   package = None
          ...   test_path = [('/myproject/src/blah/foo', ''),
          ...                ('/myproject/src/blah/bar', '')]
          >>> from zope.testrunner import coverage
          >>> from zope.testrunner.find import test_dirs
          >>> ignore = coverage.TestIgnore(test_dirs(FauxOptions(), {}))
          >>> ignore._test_dirs
          ['/myproject/src/blah/foo/', '/myproject/src/blah/bar/']
        
        We can now ask whether a particular module should be ignored:
        
          >>> ignore.names('/myproject/src/blah/foo/baz.py', 'baz')
          False
          >>> ignore.names('/myproject/src/blah/bar/mine.py', 'mine')
          False
          >>> ignore.names('/myproject/src/blah/foo/__init__.py', 'foo')
          False
          >>> ignore.names('/myproject/src/blah/hello.py', 'hello')
          True
        
        When running the test runner, modules are sometimes created from text
        strings. Those should *always* be ignored:
        
          >>> ignore.names('/myproject/src/blah/hello.txt', '<string>')
          True
        
        To make this check fast, the class implements a cache. In an early
        implementation, the result was cached by the module name, which was a problem,
        since a lot of modules carry the same name (not the Python dotted name
        here!). So just because a module has the same name in an ignored and tested
        directory, does not mean it is always ignored:
        
          >>> ignore.names('/myproject/src/blah/module.py', 'module')
          True
          >>> ignore.names('/myproject/src/blah/foo/module.py', 'module')
          False
        
        Profiling
        =========
        The testrunner supports hotshot and cProfile profilers. Hotshot profiler
        support does not work with python2.6
        
            >>> import os.path, sys
            >>> profiler = '--profile=hotshot'
            >>> if sys.hexversion >= 0x02060000:
            ...     profiler = '--profile=cProfile'
        
        The testrunner includes the ability to profile the test execution with hotshot
        via the --profile option, if it a python <= 2.6
        
            >>> directory_with_tests = os.path.join(this_directory, 'testrunner-ex')
            >>> sys.path.append(directory_with_tests)
        
            >>> defaults = [
            ...     '--path', directory_with_tests,
            ...     '--tests-pattern', '^sampletestsf?$',
            ...     ]
        
            >>> sys.argv = [testrunner_script, profiler]
        
        When the tests are run, we get profiling output.
        
            >>> from zope import testrunner
            >>> testrunner.run_internal(defaults)
            Running samplelayers.Layer1 tests:
            ...
            Running samplelayers.Layer11 tests:
            ...

            ...

            ...
            Total: ... tests, 0 failures, 0 errors in ... seconds.
            False
        
        Profiling also works across layers.
        
            >>> sys.argv = [testrunner_script, '-ssample2', profiler,
            ...             '--tests-pattern', 'sampletests_ntd']
            >>> testrunner.run_internal(defaults)
            Running...
              Tear down ... not supported...
               ncalls  tottime  percall  cumtime  percall filename:lineno(function)...
        
        The testrunner creates temnporary files containing hotshot profiler
        data:
        
            >>> import glob
            >>> files = list(glob.glob('tests_profile.*.prof'))
            >>> files.sort()
            >>> files
            ['tests_profile.cZj2jt.prof', 'tests_profile.yHD-so.prof']
        
        It deletes these when rerun.  We'll delete these ourselves:
        
            >>> import os
            >>> for f in files:
            ...     os.unlink(f)
        
        Running Without Source Code
        ===========================
        
        The ``--usecompiled`` option allows running tests in a tree without .py
        source code, provided compiled .pyc or .pyo files exist (without
        ``--usecompiled``, .py files are necessary).
        
        We have a very simple directory tree, under ``usecompiled/``, to test
        this.  Because we're going to delete its .py files, we want to work
        in a copy of that:
        
            >>> import os.path, shutil, sys, tempfile
            >>> directory_with_tests = tempfile.mkdtemp()
        
            >>> NEWNAME = "unlikely_package_name"
            >>> src = os.path.join(this_directory, 'testrunner-ex', 'usecompiled')
            >>> os.path.isdir(src)
            True
            >>> dst = os.path.join(directory_with_tests, NEWNAME)
            >>> os.path.isdir(dst)
            False
        
        Have to use our own copying code, to avoid copying read-only SVN files that
        can't be deleted later.
        
            >>> n = len(src) + 1
            >>> for root, dirs, files in os.walk(src):
            ...     dirs[:] = [d for d in dirs if d == "package"] # prune cruft
            ...     os.mkdir(os.path.join(dst, root[n:]))
            ...     for f in files:
            ...         shutil.copy(os.path.join(root, f),
            ...                     os.path.join(dst, root[n:], f))
        
        Now run the tests in the copy:
        
            >>> from zope import testrunner
        
            >>> mydefaults = [
            ...     '--path', directory_with_tests,
            ...     '--tests-pattern', '^compiletest$',
            ...     '--package', NEWNAME,
            ...     '-vv',
            ...     ]
            >>> sys.argv = ['test']
            >>> testrunner.run_internal(mydefaults)
            Running tests at level 1
            Running zope.testrunner.layer.UnitTests tests:
              Set up zope.testrunner.layer.UnitTests in N.NNN seconds.
              Running:
             test1 (unlikely_package_name.compiletest.Test)
             test2 (unlikely_package_name.compiletest.Test)
             test1 (unlikely_package_name.package.compiletest.Test)
             test2 (unlikely_package_name.package.compiletest.Test)
              Ran 4 tests with 0 failures and 0 errors in N.NNN seconds.
            Tearing down left over layers:
              Tear down zope.testrunner.layer.UnitTests in N.NNN seconds.
            False
        
        
        If we delete the source files, it's normally a disaster:  the test runner
        doesn't believe any test files, or even packages, exist.  Note that we pass
        ``--keepbytecode`` this time, because otherwise the test runner would
        delete the compiled Python files too:
        
            >>> for root, dirs, files in os.walk(dst):
            ...    for f in files:
            ...        if f.endswith(".py"):
            ...            os.remove(os.path.join(root, f))
            >>> testrunner.run_internal(mydefaults, ["test", "--keepbytecode"])
            Running tests at level 1
            Total: 0 tests, 0 failures, 0 errors in N.NNN seconds.
            False
        
        Finally, passing ``--usecompiled`` asks the test runner to treat .pyc
        and .pyo files as adequate replacements for .py files.  Note that the
        output is the same as when running with .py source above.  The absence
        of "removing stale bytecode ..." messages shows that ``--usecompiled``
        also implies ``--keepbytecode``:
        
            >>> testrunner.run_internal(mydefaults, ["test", "--usecompiled"])
            Running tests at level 1
            Running zope.testrunner.layer.UnitTests tests:

             test1 (unlikely_package_name.compiletest.Test)
             test2 (unlikely_package_name.compiletest.Test)
             test1 (unlikely_package_name.package.compiletest.Test)
             test2 (unlikely_package_name.package.compiletest.Test)
              Ran 4 tests with 0 failures and 0 errors in N.NNN seconds.
            Tearing down left over layers:
              Tear down zope.testrunner.layer.UnitTests in N.NNN seconds.
            False
        
        
        Remove the temporary directory:
        
            >>> shutil.rmtree(directory_with_tests)
        
        Repeating Tests
        ===============
        
        The --repeat option can be used to repeat tests some number of times.
        Repeating tests is useful to help make sure that tests clean up after
        themselves.
        
            >>> import os.path, sys
            >>> directory_with_tests = os.path.join(this_directory, 'testrunner-ex')
            >>> defaults = [
            ...     '--path', directory_with_tests,
            ...     '--tests-pattern', '^sampletestsf?$',
            ...     ]
        
            >>> sys.argv = 'test --layer 112 --layer UnitTests --repeat 3'.split()
            >>> from zope import testrunner
            >>> testrunner.run_internal(defaults)

            Iteration 3
              Ran 26 tests with 0 failures and 0 errors in 0.010 seconds.
            Running zope.testrunner.layer.UnitTests tests:

            False
        
        The tests are repeated by layer.  Layers are set up and torn down only
        once.
        
        Garbage Collection Control
        ==========================
        
        When having problems that seem to be caused my memory-management
        errors, it can be helpful to adjust Python's cyclic garbage collector
        or to get garbage colection statistics.  The --gc option can be used
        for this purpose.
        
        If you think you are getting a test failure due to a garbage
        collection problem, you can try disabling garbage collection by
        using the --gc option with a value of zero.
        
            >>> import os.path, sys
            >>> directory_with_tests = os.path.join(this_directory, 'testrunner-ex')
            >>> defaults = ['--path', directory_with_tests]
        
            >>> from zope import testrunner
        
            >>> sys.argv = 'test --tests-pattern ^gc0$ --gc 0 -vv'.split()
            >>> _ = testrunner.run_internal(defaults)
            Cyclic garbage collection is disabled.

        Alternatively, if you think you are having a garbage collection
        related problem, you can cause garbage collection to happen more often
        by providing a low threshold:
            
            >>> sys.argv = 'test --tests-pattern ^gc1$ --gc 1 -vv'.split()
            >>> _ = testrunner.run_internal(defaults)
            Cyclic garbage collection threshold set to: (1,)

            Tearing down left over layers:
              Tear down zope.testrunner.layer.UnitTests in N.NNN seconds.
        
        You can specify up to 3 --gc options to set each of the 3 gc threshold
        values:
        
            
            >>> sys.argv = ('test --tests-pattern ^gcset$ --gc 701 --gc 11 --gc 9 -vv'
            ...             .split())
            >>> _ = testrunner.run_internal(defaults)
            Cyclic garbage collection threshold set to: (701, 11, 9)

        Specifying more than 3 --gc options is not allowed:
        
        
            >>> from StringIO import StringIO
            >>> out = StringIO()
            >>> stdout = sys.stdout
            >>> sys.stdout = out
        
            >>> sys.argv = ('test --tests-pattern ^gcset$ --gc 701 --gc 42 --gc 11 --gc 9 -vv'
            ...             .split())
            >>> _ = testrunner.run_internal(defaults)
            Traceback (most recent call last):

        Garbage Collection Statistics
        -----------------------------
        
        You can enable gc debugging statistics using the --gc-options (-G)
        option.  You should provide names of one or more of the flags
        described in the library documentation for the gc module.
        
        The output statistics are written to standard error.  
        
            >>> from StringIO import StringIO
            >>> err = StringIO()
            >>> stderr = sys.stderr

        Debugging Memory Leaks
        ======================
        
        The --report-refcounts (-r) option can be used with the --repeat (-N)
        option to detect and diagnose memory leaks.  To use this option, you
        must configure Python with the --with-pydebug option. (On Unix, pass
        this option to configure and then build Python.)
        
            >>> import os.path, sys
            >>> directory_with_tests = os.path.join(this_directory, 'testrunner-ex')
            >>> defaults = [
            ...     '--path', directory_with_tests,

            Total: 68 tests, 0 failures, 0 errors in N.NNN seconds.
        
        Each layer is repeated the requested number of times.  For each
        iteration after the first, the system refcount and change in system
        refcount is shown. The system refcount is the total of all refcount in
        the system.  When a refcount on any object is changed, the system
        refcount is changed by the same amount.  Tests that don't leak show
        zero changes in systen refcount.
        
        Let's look at an example test that leaks:
        
            >>> sys.argv = 'test --tests-pattern leak -N4 -r'.split()
            >>> _ = testrunner.run_internal(defaults)

              Ran 1 tests with 0 failures and 0 errors in 0.000 seconds.
            Iteration 2
              Ran 1 tests with 0 failures and 0 errors in 0.000 seconds.
              sys refcount=92506    change=12
            Iteration 3
              Ran 1 tests with 0 failures and 0 errors in 0.000 seconds.
              sys refcount=92513    change=12
            Iteration 4
              Ran 1 tests with 0 failures and 0 errors in 0.000 seconds.
              sys refcount=92520    change=12
            Tearing down left over layers:
              Tear down zope.testrunner.layer.UnitTests in N.NNN seconds.
        
        Here we see that the system refcount is increating.  If we specify a
        verbosity greater than one, we can get details broken out by object
        type (or class):

            Tearing down left over layers:
              Tear down zope.testrunner.layer.UnitTests in N.NNN seconds.
        
        It is instructive to analyze the results in some detail.  The test
        being run was designed to intentionally leak:
        
            class ClassicLeakable:
                def __init__(self):
                    self.x = 'x'
        
            class Leakable(object):
                def __init__(self):
                    self.x = 'x'
        
            leaked = []
        
            class TestSomething(unittest.TestCase):
        
                def testleak(self):
                    leaked.append((ClassicLeakable(), Leakable(), time.time()))
        
        Let's go through this by type.
        
        float, leak.ClassicLeakable, leak.Leakable, and tuple
            We leak one of these every time.  This is to be expected because
            we are adding one of these to the list every time.
        
        str
            We don't leak any instances, but we leak 4 references. These are
            due to the instance attributes avd values.
        
        dict
            We leak 2 of these, one for each ClassicLeakable and Leakable
            instance. 
        
        classobj
            We increase the number of classobj instance references by one each
            time because each ClassicLeakable instance has a reference to its
            class.  This instances increases the references in it's class,
            which increases the total number of references to classic classes
            (clasobj instances).
        
        type
            For most interations, we increase the number of type references by
            one for the same reason we increase the number of clasobj
            references by one.  The increase of the number of type references
            by 3 in the second iteration is puzzling, but illustrates that
            this sort of data is often puzzling.
        
        int
            The change in the number of int instances and references in this
            example is a side effect of the statistics being gathered.  Lots
            of integers are created to keep the memory statistics used here.
        
        The summary statistics include the sum of the detail refcounts.  (Note
        that this sum is less than the system refcount.  This is because the
        detailed analysis doesn't inspect every object. Not all objects in the
        system are returned by sys.getobjects.)
        
        Knitting in extra package directories
        =====================================
        
        Python packages have __path__ variables that can be manipulated to add
        extra directories cntaining software used in the packages.  The
        testrunner needs to be given extra information about this sort of
        situation.
        
        Let's look at an example.  The testrunner-ex-knit-lib directory
        is a directory that we want to add to the Python path, but that we
        don't want to search for tests.  It has a sample4 package and a
        products subpackage.  The products subpackage adds the
        testrunner-ex-knit-products to it's __path__.  We want to run tests
        from the testrunner-ex-knit-products directory.  When we import these
        tests, we need to import them from the sample4.products package.  We
        can't use the --path option to name testrunner-ex-knit-products.
        It isn't enough to add the containing directory to the test path
        because then we wouldn't be able to determine the package name
        properly.  We might be able to use the --package option to run the
        tests from the sample4/products package, but we want to run tests in
        testrunner-ex that aren't in this package.  
        
        We can use the --package-path option in this case.  The --package-path
        option is like the --test-path option in that it defines a path to be
        searched for tests without affecting the python path.  It differs in
        that it supplied a package name that is added a profex when importing
        any modules found.  The --package-path option takes *two* arguments, a
        package name and file path.

            >>> directory_with_tests = os.path.join(this_directory, 'testrunner-ex')

        testrunner Edge Cases
        =====================
        
        This document has some edge-case examples to test various aspects of
        the test runner.
        
        Separating Python path and test directories
        -------------------------------------------
        
        The --path option defines a directory to be searched for tests *and* a
        directory to be added to Python's search path.  The --test-path option
        can be used when you want to set a test search path without also
        affecting the Python path:
        
            >>> import os, sys
            >>> directory_with_tests = os.path.join(this_directory, 'testrunner-ex')
        
            >>> from zope import testrunner
        
            >>> defaults = [
            ...     '--test-path', directory_with_tests,
            ...     '--tests-pattern', '^sampletestsf?$',
            ...     ]
            >>> sys.argv = ['test']
            >>> testrunner.run_internal(defaults)
            ... # doctest: +ELLIPSIS
            Test-module import failures:
            <BLANKLINE>
            Module: sampletestsf
            <BLANKLINE>
            Traceback (most recent call last):
            ImportError: No module named sampletestsf
            ...
        
            >>> sys.path.append(directory_with_tests)
            >>> sys.argv = ['test']
            >>> testrunner.run_internal(defaults)
            ... # doctest: +ELLIPSIS

              Set up samplelayers.Layer1 in 0.000 seconds.

            Total: 321 tests, 0 failures, 0 errors in N.NNN seconds.
            False
        
        Bug #251759: The test runner's protection against descending into non-package
        directories was ineffective, e.g. picking up tests from eggs that were stored
        close by:
        
            >>> directory_with_tests = os.path.join(this_directory, 'testrunner-ex-251759')
        
            >>> defaults = [
            ...     '--test-path', directory_with_tests,
            ...     ]
            >>> testrunner.run_internal(defaults)
            Total: 0 tests, 0 failures, 0 errors in 0.000 seconds.

        Here, the actual output uses the word "and" rather than the word "an",
        but it's a bit hard to pick this out.  We can use the various diff
        outputs to see this better. We could modify the test to ask for diff
        output, but it's easier to use one of the diff options.
        
        The --ndiff option requests a diff using Python's ndiff utility. This
        is the only method that marks differences within lines as well as
        across lines. For example, if a line of expected output contains digit
        1 where actual output contains letter l, a line is inserted with a
        caret marking the mismatching column positions.

        Testing-Module Import Errors
        ----------------------------
        
        If there are errors when importing a test module, these errors are
        reported.  In order to illustrate a module with a syntax error, we create
        one now:  this module used to be checked in to the project, but then it was
        included in distributions of projects using zope.testrunner too, and distutils
        complained about the syntax error when it compiled Python files during
        installation of such projects.  So first we create a module with bad syntax:
        
            >>> badsyntax_path = os.path.join(directory_with_tests,
            ...                               "sample2", "sampletests_i.py")
            >>> f = open(badsyntax_path, "w")
            >>> print >> f, "importx unittest"  # syntax error
            >>> f.close()
        
        Then run the tests:
        
            >>> sys.argv = ('test --tests-pattern ^sampletests(f|_i)?$ --layer 1 '
            ...            ).split()
            >>> testrunner.run_internal(defaults)

        Reporting Errors to Calling Processes
        -------------------------------------
        
        The testrunner returns the error status, indicating that the tests
        failed.  This can be useful for an invoking process that wants to
        monitor the result of a test run.
        
        This is applied when invoking the testrunner using the ``run()`` function
        instead of ``run_internal()``:
        
            >>> sys.argv = (
            ...     'test --tests-pattern ^sampletests_1$'.split())
            >>> try:
            ...     testrunner.run(defaults)
            ... except SystemExit, e:
            ...     print 'exited with code', e.code
            ... else:
            ...     print 'sys.exit was not called'
            ... # doctest: +ELLIPSIS
            Running zope.testrunner.layer.UnitTests tests:
              Set up zope.testrunner.layer.UnitTests in N.NNN seconds.
            ...

            Tearing down left over layers:
              Tear down zope.testrunner.layer.UnitTests in N.NNN seconds.
            exited with code 1
        
        Passing tests exit with code 0 according to UNIX practices:
        
            >>> sys.argv = (
            ...     'test --tests-pattern ^sampletests$'.split())
            >>> try:
            ...     testrunner.run(defaults)
            ... except SystemExit, e2:
            ...     print 'exited with code', e2.code
            ... else:
            ...     print 'sys.exit was not called'
            ... # doctest: +ELLIPSIS
