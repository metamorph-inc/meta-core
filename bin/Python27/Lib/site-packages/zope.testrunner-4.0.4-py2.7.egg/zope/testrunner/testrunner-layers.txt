Layer Selection
===============

We can select which layers to run using the --layer option:

    >>> import os.path, sys
    >>> directory_with_tests = os.path.join(this_directory, 'testrunner-ex')
    >>> defaults = [
    ...     '--path', directory_with_tests,
    ...     '--tests-pattern', '^sampletestsf?$',
    ...     ]

    >>> sys.argv = 'test --layer 112 --layer Unit'.split()
    >>> from zope import testrunner
    >>> testrunner.run_internal(defaults)
    Running samplelayers.Layer112 tests:
      Set up samplelayers.Layerx in N.NNN seconds.
      Set up samplelayers.Layer1 in N.NNN seconds.
      Set up samplelayers.Layer11 in N.NNN seconds.
      Set up samplelayers.Layer112 in N.NNN seconds.
      Ran 26 tests with 0 failures and 0 errors in N.NNN seconds.
    Running zope.testrunner.layer.UnitTests tests:
      Tear down samplelayers.Layer112 in N.NNN seconds.
      Tear down samplelayers.Layerx in N.NNN seconds.
      Tear down samplelayers.Layer11 in N.NNN seconds.
      Tear down samplelayers.Layer1 in N.NNN seconds.
      Set up zope.testrunner.layer.UnitTests in N.NNN seconds.
      Ran 156 tests with 0 failures and 0 errors in N.NNN seconds.
    Tearing down left over layers:
      Tear down zope.testrunner.layer.UnitTests in N.NNN seconds.
    Total: 182 tests, 0 failures, 0 errors in N.NNN seconds.
    False


We can also specify that we want to run only the unit tests:

    >>> sys.argv = 'test -u'.split()
    >>> testrunner.run_internal(defaults)
    Running zope.testrunner.layer.UnitTests tests:
      Set up zope.testrunner.layer.UnitTests in N.NNN seconds.
      Ran 156 tests with 0 failures and 0 errors in N.NNN seconds.
    Tearing down left over layers:
      Tear down zope.testrunner.layer.UnitTests in N.NNN seconds.
    False


Or that we want to run all of the tests except for the unit tests:

    >>> sys.argv = 'test -f'.split()
    >>> testrunner.run_internal(defaults)
    Running samplelayers.Layer1 tests:
      Set up samplelayers.Layer1 in N.NNN seconds.
      Ran 9 tests with 0 failures and 0 errors in N.NNN seconds.
    Running samplelayers.Layer11 tests:
      Set up samplelayers.Layer11 in N.NNN seconds.
      Ran 26 tests with 0 failures and 0 errors in N.NNN seconds.
    Running samplelayers.Layer111 tests:
      Set up samplelayers.Layerx in N.NNN seconds.
      Set up samplelayers.Layer111 in N.NNN seconds.
      Ran 26 tests with 0 failures and 0 errors in N.NNN seconds.
    Running samplelayers.Layer112 tests:
      Tear down samplelayers.Layer111 in N.NNN seconds.
      Set up samplelayers.Layer112 in N.NNN seconds.
      Ran 26 tests with 0 failures and 0 errors in N.NNN seconds.

      Tear down samplelayers.Layerx in N.NNN seconds.
      Tear down samplelayers.Layer11 in N.NNN seconds.
      Set up samplelayers.Layer12 in N.NNN seconds.
      Ran 26 tests with 0 failures and 0 errors in N.NNN seconds.
    Running samplelayers.Layer121 tests:
      Set up samplelayers.Layer121 in N.NNN seconds.
      Ran 26 tests with 0 failures and 0 errors in N.NNN seconds.
    Running samplelayers.Layer122 tests:
      Tear down samplelayers.Layer121 in N.NNN seconds.
      Set up samplelayers.Layer122 in N.NNN seconds.
      Ran 26 tests with 0 failures and 0 errors in N.NNN seconds.
    Tearing down left over layers:
      Tear down samplelayers.Layer122 in N.NNN seconds.
      Tear down samplelayers.Layer12 in N.NNN seconds.
      Tear down samplelayers.Layer1 in N.NNN seconds.
    Total: 165 tests, 0 failures, 0 errors in N.NNN seconds.
    False

Or we can explicitly say that we want both unit and non-unit tests.

    >>> sys.argv = 'test -uf'.split()
    >>> testrunner.run_internal(defaults)

      Set up samplelayers.Layer1 in N.NNN seconds.

      Set up samplelayers.Layerx in N.NNN seconds.
      Set up samplelayers.Layer111 in N.NNN seconds.

      Ran 26 tests with 0 failures and 0 errors in N.NNN seconds.

      Tear down samplelayers.Layer122 in N.NNN seconds.

    False

It is possible to force the layers to run in subprocesses and parallelize them.

    >>> testrunner.run_internal(defaults)
