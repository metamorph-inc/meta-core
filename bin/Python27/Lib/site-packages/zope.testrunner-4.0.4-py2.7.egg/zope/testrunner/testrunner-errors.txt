Errors and Failures
===================

Let's look at tests that have errors and failures, first we need to make a
temporary copy of the entire testing directory (except .svn files which may
be read only):

    >>> import os.path, sys, tempfile, shutil
    >>> tmpdir = tempfile.mkdtemp()
    >>> directory_with_tests = os.path.join(tmpdir, 'testrunner-ex')
    >>> source = os.path.join(this_directory, 'testrunner-ex')
    >>> n = len(source) + 1
    >>> for root, dirs, files in os.walk(source):
    ...     dirs[:] = [d for d in dirs if d != ".svn"] # prune cruft
    ...     os.mkdir(os.path.join(directory_with_tests, root[n:]))
    ...     for f in files:
    ...         shutil.copy(os.path.join(root, f),
    ...                     os.path.join(directory_with_tests, root[n:], f))

    >>> from zope import testrunner
    >>> defaults = [
    ...     '--path', directory_with_tests,
    ...     '--tests-pattern', '^sampletestsf?$',
    ...     ]

    >>> sys.argv = 'test --tests-pattern ^sampletests(f|_e|_f)?$ '.split()
    >>> testrunner.run_internal(defaults)
    ... # doctest: +NORMALIZE_WHITESPACE +ELLIPSIS

We see that we get an error report and a traceback for the failing
test.  In addition, the test runner returned True, indicating that
there was an error.

If we ask for verbosity, the dotted output will be interrupted, and
there'll be a summary of the errors at the end of the test:

Suppressing multiple doctest errors
-----------------------------------

Often, when a doctest example fails, the failure will cause later
examples in the same test to fail.  Each failure is reported:

This can be a bit confusing, especially when there are enough tests
that they scroll off a screen.  Often you just want to see the first
failure.  This can be accomplished with the -1 option (for "just show
me the first failed example in a doctest" :)

if -1 is provided by a test script by inserting it ahead of
command-line options in sys.argv.

Getting diff output for doctest failures
----------------------------------------

If a doctest has large expected and actual output, it can be hard to
see differences when expected and actual output differ.  The --ndiff,
--udiff, and --cdiff options can be used to get diff output of various
kinds.

Here, the actual output uses the word "and" rather than the word "an",
but it's a bit hard to pick this out.  We can use the various diff
outputs to see this better. We could modify the test to ask for diff
output, but it's easier to use one of the diff options.

The --ndiff option requests a diff using Python's ndiff utility. This
is the only method that marks differences within lines as well as
across lines. For example, if a line of expected output contains digit
1 where actual output contains letter l, a line is inserted with a
caret marking the mismatching column positions.

Testing-Module Import Errors
----------------------------

If there are errors when importing a test module, these errors are
reported.  In order to illustrate a module with a syntax error, we create
one now:  this module used to be checked in to the project, but then it was
included in distributions of projects using zope.testrunner too, and distutils
complained about the syntax error when it compiled Python files during
installation of such projects.  So first we create a module with bad syntax:

    >>> badsyntax_path = os.path.join(directory_with_tests,
    ...                               "sample2", "sampletests_i.py")
    >>> f = open(badsyntax_path, "w")
    >>> print >> f, "importx unittest"  # syntax error
    >>> f.close()

Then run the tests:

    >>> sys.argv = ('test --tests-pattern ^sampletests(f|_i)?$ --layer 1 '
    ...            ).split()
    >>> testrunner.run_internal(defaults)

Reporting Errors to Calling Processes
-------------------------------------

The testrunner returns the error status, indicating that the tests
failed.  This can be useful for an invoking process that wants to
monitor the result of a test run.

This is applied when invoking the testrunner using the ``run()`` function
instead of ``run_internal()``:

    >>> sys.argv = (
    ...     'test --tests-pattern ^sampletests_1$'.split())
    >>> try:
    ...     testrunner.run(defaults)
    ... except SystemExit, e:
    ...     print 'exited with code', e.code
    ... else:
    ...     print 'sys.exit was not called'
    ... # doctest: +ELLIPSIS
    Running zope.testrunner.layer.UnitTests tests:
      Set up zope.testrunner.layer.UnitTests in N.NNN seconds.
    ...
      Ran 1 tests with 1 failures and 0 errors in 0.002 seconds.
    Tearing down left over layers:
      Tear down zope.testrunner.layer.UnitTests in N.NNN seconds.
    exited with code 1

Passing tests exit with code 0 according to UNIX practices:

    >>> sys.argv = (
    ...     'test --tests-pattern ^sampletests$'.split())
    >>> try:
    ...     testrunner.run(defaults)
    ... except SystemExit, e2:
    ...     print 'exited with code', e2.code
    ... else:
    ...     print 'sys.exit was not called'
    ... # doctest: +ELLIPSIS

      Tear down zope.testrunner.layer.UnitTests in N.NNN seconds.
    Total: 286 tests, 0 failures, 0 errors in N.NNN seconds.
    exited with code 0

And remove the temporary directory:

    >>> shutil.rmtree(tmpdir)
