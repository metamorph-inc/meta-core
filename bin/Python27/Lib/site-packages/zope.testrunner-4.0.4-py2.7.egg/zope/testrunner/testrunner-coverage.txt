Code Coverage
=============

If the --coverage option is used, test coverage reports will be generated.  The
directory name given as the parameter will be used to hold the reports.


    >>> import os.path, sys
    >>> directory_with_tests = os.path.join(this_directory, 'testrunner-ex')
    >>> defaults = [
    ...     '--path', directory_with_tests,
    ...     '--tests-pattern', '^sampletestsf?$',
    ...     ]

    >>> sys.argv = 'test --coverage=coverage_dir'.split()

    >>> from zope import testrunner
    >>> testrunner.run_internal(defaults)

The directory specified with the --coverage option will have been created and
will hold the coverage reports.

    >>> os.path.exists('coverage_dir')
    True
    >>> os.listdir('coverage_dir')
    [...]

(We should clean up after ourselves.)

    >>> import shutil
    >>> shutil.rmtree('coverage_dir')


Ignoring Tests
--------------

The ``trace`` module supports ignoring directories and modules based the test
selection. Only directories selected for testing should report coverage. The
test runner provides a custom implementation of the relevant API.

The ``TestIgnore`` class, the class managing the ignoring, is initialized by
passing the command line options. It uses the options to determine the
directories that should be covered.

  >>> class FauxOptions(object):
  ...   package = None
  ...   test_path = [('/myproject/src/blah/foo', ''),
  ...                ('/myproject/src/blah/bar', '')]
  >>> from zope.testrunner import coverage
  >>> from zope.testrunner.find import test_dirs
  >>> ignore = coverage.TestIgnore(test_dirs(FauxOptions(), {}))
  >>> ignore._test_dirs
  ['/myproject/src/blah/foo/', '/myproject/src/blah/bar/']

We can now ask whether a particular module should be ignored:

  >>> ignore.names('/myproject/src/blah/foo/baz.py', 'baz')
  False
  >>> ignore.names('/myproject/src/blah/bar/mine.py', 'mine')
  False
  >>> ignore.names('/myproject/src/blah/foo/__init__.py', 'foo')
  False
  >>> ignore.names('/myproject/src/blah/hello.py', 'hello')
  True

When running the test runner, modules are sometimes created from text
strings. Those should *always* be ignored:

  >>> ignore.names('/myproject/src/blah/hello.txt', '<string>')
  True

To make this check fast, the class implements a cache. In an early
implementation, the result was cached by the module name, which was a problem,
since a lot of modules carry the same name (not the Python dotted name
here!). So just because a module has the same name in an ignored and tested
directory, does not mean it is always ignored:

  >>> ignore.names('/myproject/src/blah/module.py', 'module')
  True
  >>> ignore.names('/myproject/src/blah/foo/module.py', 'module')
  False
