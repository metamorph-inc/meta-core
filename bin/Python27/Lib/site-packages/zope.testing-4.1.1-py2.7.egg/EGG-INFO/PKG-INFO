        This package provides a number of testing frameworks.
        
        cleanup
          Provides a mixin class for cleaning up after tests that
          make global changes.
        
        formparser
          An HTML parser that extracts form information.
        
          **Python 2 only**
        
          This is intended to support functional tests that need to extract
          information from HTML forms returned by the publisher.
        
          See formparser.txt.
        
        loggingsupport
          Support for testing logging code
        
          If you want to test that your code generates proper log output, you
          can create and install a handler that collects output.
        
        loghandler
          Logging handler for tests that check logging output.
        
        module
          Lets a doctest pretend to be a Python module.
        
          See module.txt.
        
        renormalizing
          Regular expression pattern normalizing output checker.
          Useful for doctests.
        
        server
          Provides a simple HTTP server compatible with the zope.app.testing
          functional testing API.  Lets you interactively play with the system
          under test.  Helpful in debugging functional doctest failures.
        
          **Python 2 only**
        
        setupstack
          A simple framework for automating doctest set-up and tear-down.
          See setupstack.txt.
        
        wait
          A small utility for dealing with timing non-determinism
          See wait.txt.
        
        Getting started
        ***************
        
        zope.testing uses buildout.  To start, run ``python bootstrap.py``.  It will
        create a number of directories and the ``bin/buildout`` script.  Next, run
        ``bin/buildout``.  It will create a test script for you.  Now, run ``bin/test``
        to run the zope.testing test suite.

        Parsing HTML Forms
        ==================
        
        Sometimes in functional tests, information from a generated form must
        be extracted in order to re-submit it as part of a subsequent request.
        The `zope.testing.formparser` module can be used for this purpose.
        
        NOTE
           formparser doesn't support Python 3.
        
        The scanner is implemented using the `FormParser` class.  The
        constructor arguments are the page data containing the form and
        (optionally) the URL from which the page was retrieved:
        
          >>> import zope.testing.formparser
        
          >>> page_text = '''\
          ... <html><body>
          ...   <form name="form1" action="/cgi-bin/foobar.py" method="POST">
          ...     <input type="hidden" name="f1" value="today" />
          ...     <input type="submit" name="do-it-now" value="Go for it!" />
          ...     <input type="IMAGE" name="not-really" value="Don't."
          ...            src="dont.png" />
          ...     <select name="pick-two" size="3" multiple>
          ...       <option value="one" selected>First</option>
          ...       <option value="two" label="Second">Another</option>
          ...       <optgroup>
          ...         <option value="three">Third</option>
          ...         <option selected="selected">Fourth</option>
          ...       </optgroup>
          ...     </select>
          ...   </form>
          ...
          ...   Just for fun, a second form, after specifying a base:
          ...   <base href="http://www.example.com/base/" />
          ...   <form action = 'sproing/sprung.html' enctype="multipart/form">
          ...     <textarea name="sometext" rows="5">Some text.</textarea>
          ...     <input type="Image" name="action" value="Do something."
          ...            src="else.png" />
          ...     <input type="text" value="" name="multi" size="2" />
          ...     <input type="text" value="" name="multi" size="3" />
          ...   </form>
          ... </body></html>
          ... '''
        
          >>> parser = zope.testing.formparser.FormParser(page_text)
          >>> forms = parser.parse()
        
          >>> len(forms)
          2
          >>> forms.form1 is forms[0]
          True
          >>> forms.form1 is forms[1]
          False
        
        More often, the `parse()` convenience function is all that's needed:
        
          >>> forms = zope.testing.formparser.parse(
          ...     page_text, "http://cgi.example.com/somewhere/form.html")
        
          >>> len(forms)
          2
          >>> forms.form1 is forms[0]
          True
          >>> forms.form1 is forms[1]
          False
        
        Once we have the form we're interested in, we can check form
        attributes and individual field values:
        
          >>> form = forms.form1
          >>> form.enctype
          'application/x-www-form-urlencoded'
          >>> form.method
          'post'
        
          >>> keys = form.keys()
          >>> keys.sort()
          >>> keys
          ['do-it-now', 'f1', 'not-really', 'pick-two']
        
          >>> not_really = form["not-really"]
          >>> not_really.type
          'image'
          >>> not_really.value
          "Don't."
          >>> not_really.readonly
          False
          >>> not_really.disabled
          False
        
        Note that relative URLs are converted to absolute URLs based on the
        ``<base>`` element (if present) or using the base passed in to the
        constructor.
        
          >>> form.action
          'http://cgi.example.com/cgi-bin/foobar.py'
          >>> not_really.src
          'http://cgi.example.com/somewhere/dont.png'
        
          >>> forms[1].action
          'http://www.example.com/base/sproing/sprung.html'
          >>> forms[1]["action"].src
          'http://www.example.com/base/else.png'
        
        Fields which are repeated are reported as lists of objects that
        represent each instance of the field::
        
          >>> field = forms[1]["multi"]
          >>> isinstance(field, list)
          True
          >>> [o.value for o in field]
          ['', '']
          >>> [o.size for o in field]
          [2, 3]
        
        The ``<textarea>`` element provides some additional attributes:
        
          >>> ta = forms[1]["sometext"]
          >>> print ta.rows
          5
          >>> print ta.cols
          None
          >>> ta.value
          'Some text.'
        
        The ``<select>`` element provides access to the options as well:
        
          >>> select = form["pick-two"]
          >>> select.multiple
          True
          >>> select.size
          3
          >>> select.type
          'select'
          >>> select.value
          ['one', 'Fourth']
        
          >>> options = select.options
          >>> len(options)
          4
          >>> [opt.label for opt in options]
          ['First', 'Second', 'Third', 'Fourth']
          >>> [opt.value for opt in options]
          ['one', 'two', 'three', 'Fourth']
        
        Support for testing logging code
        ================================
        
        If you want to test that your code generates proper log output, you
        can create and install a handler that collects output:
        
          >>> from zope.testing.loggingsupport import InstalledHandler
          >>> handler = InstalledHandler('foo.bar')
        
        The handler is installed into loggers for all of the names passed. In
        addition, the logger level is set to 1, which means, log
        everything. If you want to log less than everything, you can provide a
        level keyword argument.  The level setting effects only the named
        loggers.
        
          >>> import logging
          >>> handler_with_levels = InstalledHandler('baz', level=logging.WARNING)
        
        Then, any log output is collected in the handler:
        
          >>> logging.getLogger('foo.bar').exception('eek')
          >>> logging.getLogger('foo.bar').info('blah blah')
        
          >>> for record in handler.records:
          ...     print_(record.name, record.levelname)
          ...     print_(' ', record.getMessage())
          foo.bar ERROR
            eek
          foo.bar INFO
            blah blah
        
        A similar effect can be gotten by just printing the handler:
        
          >>> print_(handler)
          foo.bar ERROR
            eek
          foo.bar INFO
            blah blah
        
        After checking the log output, you need to uninstall the handler:
        
          >>> handler.uninstall()
          >>> handler_with_levels.uninstall()
        
        At which point, the handler won't get any more log output.
        Let's clear the handler:
        
          >>> handler.clear()
          >>> handler.records
          []
        
        And then log something:
        
          >>> logging.getLogger('foo.bar').info('blah')
        
        and, sure enough, we still have no output:
        
          >>> handler.records
          []
        
        Regular expression pattern normalizing output checker
        =====================================================
        
        The pattern-normalizing output checker extends the default output checker with
        an option to normalize expected and actual output.
        
        You specify a sequence of patterns and replacements.  The replacements are
        applied to the expected and actual outputs before calling the default outputs
        checker.  Let's look at an example.  In this example, we have some times and
        addresses:
        
            >>> want = '''\
            ... <object object at 0xb7f14438>
            ... completed in 1.234 seconds.
            ... <BLANKLINE>
            ... <object object at 0xb7f14440>
            ... completed in 123.234 seconds.
            ... <BLANKLINE>
            ... <object object at 0xb7f14448>
            ... completed in .234 seconds.
            ... <BLANKLINE>
            ... <object object at 0xb7f14450>
            ... completed in 1.234 seconds.
            ... <BLANKLINE>
            ... '''
        
            >>> got = '''\
            ... <object object at 0xb7f14458>
            ... completed in 1.235 seconds.
            ...
            ... <object object at 0xb7f14460>
            ... completed in 123.233 seconds.
            ...
            ... <object object at 0xb7f14468>
            ... completed in .231 seconds.
            ...
            ... <object object at 0xb7f14470>
            ... completed in 1.23 seconds.
            ...
            ... '''
        
        We may wish to consider these two strings to match, even though they differ in
        actual addresses and times.  The default output checker will consider them
        different:
        
            >>> import doctest
            >>> doctest.OutputChecker().check_output(want, got, 0)
            False
        
        We'll use the zope.testing.renormalizing.OutputChecker to normalize both the
        wanted and gotten strings to ignore differences in times and
        addresses:
        
            >>> import re
            >>> from zope.testing.renormalizing import OutputChecker
            >>> checker = OutputChecker([
            ...    (re.compile('[0-9]*[.][0-9]* seconds'), '<SOME NUMBER OF> seconds'),
            ...    (re.compile('at 0x[0-9a-f]+'), 'at <SOME ADDRESS>'),
            ...    ])
        
            >>> checker.check_output(want, got, 0)
            True
        
        Usual OutputChecker options work as expected:
        
            >>> want_ellided = '''\
            ... <object object at 0xb7f14438>
            ... completed in 1.234 seconds.
            ... ...
            ... <object object at 0xb7f14450>
            ... completed in 1.234 seconds.
            ... <BLANKLINE>
            ... '''
        
            >>> checker.check_output(want_ellided, got, 0)
            False
        
            >>> checker.check_output(want_ellided, got, doctest.ELLIPSIS)
            True
        
        When we get differencs, we output them with normalized text:
        
            >>> source = '''\
            ... >>> do_something()
            ... <object object at 0xb7f14438>

            ... ...

            ... <BLANKLINE>
            ... '''
        
            >>> example = doctest.Example(source, want_ellided)
        
            >>> print_(checker.output_difference(example, got, 0))
            Expected:

            Differences (ndiff with -expected +actual):

            If the wanted text is empty, however, we don't transform the actual output.
            This is usful when writing tests.  We leave the expected output empty, run
            the test, and use the actual output as expected, after reviewing it.

        If regular expressions aren't expressive enough, you can use arbitrary Python
        callables to transform the text.  For example, suppose you want to ignore
        case during comparison:
        
            >>> checker = OutputChecker([
            ...    lambda s: s.lower(),
            ...    lambda s: s.replace('<blankline>', '<BLANKLINE>'),
            ...    ])
        
            >>> want = '''\
            ... Usage: thundermonkey [options] [url]
            ... <BLANKLINE>
            ... Options:
            ...     -h    display this help message
            ... '''
        
            >>> got = '''\
            ... usage: thundermonkey [options] [URL]
            ...
            ... options:
            ...     -h    Display this help message
            ... '''
        
            >>> checker.check_output(want, got, 0)
            True
        
        Suppose we forgot that <BLANKLINE> must be in upper case:
        
            >>> checker = OutputChecker([
            ...    lambda s: s.lower(),
            ...    ])
        
            >>> checker.check_output(want, got, 0)
            False
        
        The difference would show us that:
        
            >>> source = '''\
            ... >>> print_help_message()
            ... ''' + want
            >>> example = doctest.Example(source, want)
            >>> print_(checker.output_difference(example, got,
            ...                                 doctest.REPORT_NDIFF))
            Differences (ndiff with -expected +actual):
                  usage: thundermonkey [options] [url]
                - <blankline>
                + <BLANKLINE>
                  options:
                      -h    display this help message
            <BLANKLINE>
        
        
        It is possible to combine OutputChecker checkers for easy reuse:
        
            >>> address_and_time_checker = OutputChecker([
            ...    (re.compile('[0-9]*[.][0-9]* seconds'), '<SOME NUMBER OF> seconds'),
            ...    (re.compile('at 0x[0-9a-f]+'), 'at <SOME ADDRESS>'),
            ...    ])
            >>> lowercase_checker = OutputChecker([
            ...    lambda s: s.lower(),
            ...    ])
            >>> combined_checker = address_and_time_checker + lowercase_checker
            >>> len(combined_checker.transformers)
            3
        
        Combining a checker with something else does not work:
        
            >>> lowercase_checker + 5 #doctest: +ELLIPSIS
            Traceback (most recent call last):
                ...
            TypeError: unsupported operand type(s) for +: ...
        
        
        Stack-based test setUp and tearDown
        ===================================
        
        Writing doctest setUp and tearDown functions can be a bit tedious,
        especially when setUp/tearDown functions are combined.
        
        the zope.testing.setupstack module provides a small framework for
        automating test tear down.  It provides a generic setUp function that
        sets up a stack. Normal test setUp functions call this function to set
        up the stack and then use the register function to register tear-down
        functions.
        
        To see how this works we'll create a faux test:
        
            >>> class Test:
            ...     def __init__(self):
            ...         self.globs = {}
            >>> test = Test()
        
        We'll register some tearDown functions that just print something:
        
            >>> import sys
            >>> import zope.testing.setupstack
            >>> zope.testing.setupstack.register(
            ...     test, lambda : sys.stdout.write('td 1\n'))
            >>> zope.testing.setupstack.register(
            ...     test, lambda : sys.stdout.write('td 2\n'))
        
        Now, when we call the tearDown function:
        
            >>> zope.testing.setupstack.tearDown(test)
            td 2
            td 1
        
        The registered tearDown functions are run. Note that they are run in
        the reverse order that they were registered.
        
        
        Extra positional arguments can be passed to register:
        
            >>> zope.testing.setupstack.register(
            ...    test, lambda x, y, z: sys.stdout.write('%s %s %s\n' % (x, y, z)),
            ...    1, 2, z=9)
            >>> zope.testing.setupstack.tearDown(test)
            1 2 9
        
        
        Temporary Test Directory
        ------------------------
        
        Often, tests create files as they demonstrate functionality.  They
        need to arrange for the removeal of these files when the test is
        cleaned up.
        
        The setUpDirectory function automates this.  We'll get the current
        directory first:
        
            >>> import os
            >>> here = os.getcwd()
        
        We'll also create a new test:
        
            >>> test = Test()
        
        Now we'll call the setUpDirectory function:
        
            >>> zope.testing.setupstack.setUpDirectory(test)
        
        We don't have to call zope.testing.setupstack.setUp, because
        setUpDirectory calls it for us.
        
        Now the current working directory has changed:
        
            >>> here == os.getcwd()
            False
            >>> setupstack_cwd = os.getcwd()
        
        We can create files to out heart's content:
        
            >>> foo = open('Data.fs', 'w').write('xxx')
            >>> os.path.exists(os.path.join(setupstack_cwd, 'Data.fs'))
            True
        
        We'll make the file read-only. This can cause problems on Windows, but
        setupstack takes care of that by making files writable before trying
        to remove them.
        
            >>> import stat
            >>> os.chmod('Data.fs', stat.S_IREAD)
        
        On Unix systems, broken symlinks can cause problems because the chmod
        attempt by the teardown hook will fail; let's set up a broken symlink as
        well, and verify the teardown doesn't break because of that:
        
            >>> if hasattr(os, 'symlink'):
            ...     os.symlink('NotThere', 'BrokenLink')
        
        When tearDown is called:
        
            >>> zope.testing.setupstack.tearDown(test)
        
        We'll be back where we started:
        
            >>> here == os.getcwd()
            True
        
        and the files we created will be gone (along with the temporary
        directory that was created:
        
            >>> os.path.exists(os.path.join(setupstack_cwd, 'Data.fs'))
            False
        
        Context-manager support
        -----------------------
        
        You can leverage context managers using the ``contextmanager`` method.
        The result of calling the content manager's __enter__ method will be
        returned. The context-manager's __exit__ method will be called as part
        of test tear down:
        
            >>> class Manager(object):
            ...     def __enter__(self):
            ...         print_('enter')
            ...         return 42
            ...     def __exit__(self, *args):
            ...         print_('exit', args)
        
            >>> manager = Manager()
            >>> test = Test()
        
            >>> zope.testing.setupstack.context_manager(test, manager)
            enter
            42
        
            >>> zope.testing.setupstack.tearDown(test)
            exit (None, None, None)
        
        globs
        -----
        
        Doctests have ``globs`` attributes used to hold test globals.
        ``setupstack`` was originally designed to work with doctests, but can
        now work with either doctests, or other test objects, as long as the
        test objects have either a ``globs`` attribute or a ``__dict__``
        attribute.  The ``zope.testing.setupstack.globs`` function is used to
        get the globals for a test object:
        
            >>> zope.testing.setupstack.globs(test) is test.globs
            True
        
        Here, because the test object had a ``globs`` attribute, it was
        returned. Because we used the test object above, it has a setupstack:
        
            >>> '__zope.testing.setupstack' in test.globs
            True
        
        If we remove the ``globs`` attribute, the object's instance dictionary
        will be used:
        
            >>> del test.globs
            >>> zope.testing.setupstack.globs(test) is test.__dict__
            True
            >>> zope.testing.setupstack.context_manager(test, manager)
            enter
            42
        
            >>> '__zope.testing.setupstack' in test.__dict__
            True
        
        The ``globs`` function is used internally, but can also be used by
        setup code to support either doctests or other test objects.
        
        Wait until a condition holds (or until a time out)
        ==================================================
        
        Often, in tests, you need to wait until some condition holds.  This
        may be because you're testing interaction with an external system or
        testing threaded (threads, processes, greenlet's, etc.) interactions.
        
        You can add sleeps to your tests, but it's often hard to know how
        long to sleep.
        
        ``zope.testing.wait`` provides a convenient way to wait until
        some condition holds.  It will test a condition and, when true,
        return.  It will sleep a short time between tests.
        
        Here's a silly example, that illustrates it's use:
        
            >>> from zope.testing.wait import wait
            >>> wait(lambda : True)
        
        Since the condition we passed is always True, it returned
        immediately.  If the condition doesn't hold, then we'll get a timeout:
        
            >>> wait((lambda : False), timeout=.01)
            Traceback (most recent call last):
            ...
            TimeOutWaitingFor: <lambda>
        
        ``wait`` has some keyword options:
        
        timeout
           How long, in seconds, to wait for the condition to hold
        
           Defaults to 9 seconds.
        
        wait
           How long to wait between calls.
        
           Defaults to .01 seconds.
        
        message
           A message (or other data) to pass to the timeout exception.
        
           This defaults to ``None``.  If this is false, then the callable's
           doc string or ``__name__`` is used.
        
        ``wait`` can be used as a decorator:
        
            >>> @wait
            ... def ok():
            ...     return True
        
            >>> @wait(timeout=.01)
            ... def no_way():
            ...     pass
            Traceback (most recent call last):
            ...
            TimeOutWaitingFor: no_way
        
            >>> @wait(timeout=.01)
            ... def no_way():
            ...     "never true"
            Traceback (most recent call last):
            ...
            TimeOutWaitingFor: never true
        
        .. more tests
        
            >>> import time
            >>> now = time.time()
            >>> @wait(timeout=.01, message='dang')
            ... def no_way():
            ...     "never true"
            Traceback (most recent call last):
            ...
            TimeOutWaitingFor: dang
        
            >>> .01 < (time.time() - now) < .03
            True
        
        
        Customization
        -------------
        
        ``wait`` is an instance of ``Wait``.  With ``Wait``,
        you can create you're own custom ``wait`` utilities.  For
        example, if you're testing something that uses getevent, you'd want to
        use gevent's sleep function:
        
            >>> import zope.testing.wait
            >>> wait = zope.testing.wait.Wait(getsleep=lambda : gevent.sleep)
        
        Wait takes a number of customization parameters:
        
        exception
          Timeout exception class
        
        getnow
          Function used to get a function for getting the current time.
        
          Default: lambda : time.time
        
        getsleep
          Function used to get a sleep function.
        
          Default: lambda : time.sleep
        
        timeout
          Default timeout
        
          Default: 9
        
        wait
          Default time to wait between attempts
        
          Default: .01
        
        
        .. more tests
        
            >>> def mysleep(t):
            ...     print_('mysleep', t)
            ...     time.sleep(t)
        
            >>> def mynow():

        zope.testing Changelog
        **********************
        
        4.1.1 (2012-02-01)
        ==================
        
        - Fixed: Windows test failure.
        
        4.1.0 (2012-01-29)
        ==================
        
        - Added context-manager support to ``zope.testing.setupstack``
        
        - Made ``zope.testing.setupstack`` usable with all tests, not just
          doctests and added ``zope.testing.setupstack.globs``, which makes it
          easier to write test setup code that workes with doctests and other
          kinds of tests.
        
        - Added the ``wait`` module, which makes it easier to deal with
          non-deterministic timing issues.
        
        - Renamed ``zope.testing.renormalizing.RENormalizing`` to
          ``zope.testing.renormalizing.OutputChecker``. The old name is an
          alias.
        
        - Updated tests to run with Python 3.
        
        - More clearly labeled which features were supported by Python 3.
        
        - Reorganized documentation.
        
        4.0.0 (2011-11-09)
        ==================
        
        - Removes the deprecated zope.testing.doctest.
        
        - Adds Python 3 support.
        
        - Fixed test which fails if there is a file named `Data.fs` in the current
          working directory.
        
        
        3.10.2 (2010-11-30)
        ===================
        
        - Fix test of broken symlink handling to not break on Windows.
        
        
        3.10.1 (2010-11-29)
        ===================
        
        - Fix removal of broken symlinks on Unix.
        
        
        3.10.0 (2010-07-21)
        ===================
        
        - Removed zope.testing.testrunner, which now is moved to zope.testrunner.
        
        - Update fix for LP #221151 to a spelling compatible with Python 2.4.
        
        3.9.5 (2010-05-19)
        ==================
        
        - LP #579019: When layers were run in parallel, their tearDown was not
          called. Additionally, the first layer which was run in the main
          thread did not have it's tearDown called either.
        
        - Deprecated zope.testing.testrunner and zope.testing.exceptions. They have
          been moved to a separate zope.testrunner module, and will be removed from
          zope.testing in 4.0.0, together with zope.testing.doctest.
        
        3.9.4 (2010-04-13)
        ==================
        
        - LP #560259: Fix subunit output formatter to handle layer setup
          errors.
        
        - LP #399394:  Added a ``--stop-on-error`` / ``--stop`` / ``-x`` option to
          the testrunner.
        
        - LP #498162:  Added a ``--pdb`` alias for the existing ``--post-mortem``
          / ``-D`` option to the testrunner.
        
        - LP #547023:  Added a ``--version`` option to the testrunner.
        
        - Added tests for LP #144569 and #69988.

          https://bugs.launchpad.net/zope3/+bug/144569
        
        
        3.9.3 (2010-03-26)
        ==================
        
        - zope.testing.renormalizer no longer imports zope.testing.doctest, which
          caused deprecation warnings.
        
        - Fix testrunner-layers-ntd.txt to suppress output to sys.stderr.
        
        - Suppress zope.testing.doctest deprecation warning when running
          zope.testing's own test suite.
        
        
        3.9.2 (2010-03-15)
        ==================
        
        - Fixed broken ``from zope.testing.doctest import *``
        
        3.9.1 (2010-03-15)
        ==================
        
        - No changes; reuploaded to fix broken 3.9.0 release on PyPI.
        
        3.9.0 (2010-03-12)
        ==================
        
        - Modified the testrunner to use the standard Python doctest module instead of
          the deprecated zope.testing.doctest.
        
        - Fix testrunner-leaks.txt to use the run_internal helper, so that
          sys.exit() isn't triggered during the test run.
        
        - Added support for conditionally using a subunit-based output
          formatter upon request if subunit and testtools are available. Patch
          contributed by Jonathan Lange.
        
        3.8.7 (2010-01-26)
        ==================
        
        - Downgraded the zope.testing.doctest deprecation warning into a
          PendingDeprecationWarning.
        
        3.8.6 (2009-12-23)
        ==================
        
        - Added MANIFEST.in and reuploaded to fix broken 3.8.5 release on PyPI.
        
        
        3.8.5 (2009-12-23)
        ==================
        
        - Added DocFileSuite, DocTestSuite, debug_src and debug back BBB imports
          back into zope.testing.doctestunit; apparently many packages still import
          them from there!
        
        - Made zope.testing.doctest and zope.testing.doctestunit emit deprecation
          warnings: use the stdlib doctest instead.
        
        
        3.8.4 (2009-12-18)
        ==================
        
        - Fixed missing imports and undefined variables reported by pyflakes,
          adding tests to exercise the blind spots.
        
        - Cleaned up unused imports reported by pyflakes.
        
        - Added two new options to generate randomly ordered list of tests and to
          select a specific order of tests.
        
        - RENormalizing checkers can be combined via ``+`` now:
          ``checker1 + checker2`` creates a checker with the transformations of both
          checkers.
        
        - Test fixes for Python 2.7.
        
        3.8.3 (2009-09-21)
        ==================
        
        - Avoid a split() call or we get test failures when running from a directory
          with spaces in it.
        
        - Fix testrunner behavior on Windows for -j2 (or greater) combined with -v
          (or greater).
        
        3.8.2 (2009-09-15)
        ==================
        
        - Removing hotshot profiler when using Python 2.6. That makes zope.testing
          compatible with Python 2.6
        
        
        3.8.1 (2009-08-12)
        ==================
        
        - Avoid hardcoding sys.argv[0] as script;
          allow, for instance, Zope 2's `bin/instance test` (LP#407916).
        
        - Produce a clear error message when a subprocess doesn't follow the
          zope.testing.testrunner protocol (LP#407916).
        
        - Do not unnecessarily squelch verbose output in a subprocess when there are
          not multiple subprocesses.
        
        - Do not unnecessarily batch subprocess output, which can stymie automated and
          human processes for identifying hung tests.
        
        - Include incremental output when there are multiple subprocesses and a
          verbosity of -vv or greater is requested.  This again is not batched,
          supporting automated processes and humans looking for hung tests.
        
        
        3.8.0 (2009-07-24)
        ==================
        
        - Testrunner automatically picks up descendants of unittest.TestCase in test
          modules, so you don't have to provide a test_suite() anymore.
        
        
        3.7.7 (2009-07-15)
        ==================
        
        - Clean up support for displaying tracebacks with supplements by turning it
          into an always-enabled feature and making the dependency on zope.exceptions
          explicit.
        
        - Fix #251759: Test runner descended into directories that aren't Python
          packages.
        
        - Code cleanups.
        
        
        3.7.6 (2009-07-02)
        ==================
        
        - Add zope-testrunner console_scripts entry point. This exposes a
          zope-testrunner binary with default installs allowing the testrunner to be
          run from the command line.
        
        3.7.5 (2009-06-08)
        ==================
        
        - Fix bug when running subprocesses on Windows.
        
        - The option REPORT_ONLY_FIRST_FAILURE (command line option "-1") is now
          respected even when a doctest declares its own REPORTING_FLAGS, such as
          REPORT_NDIFF.
        
        - Fixed bug that broke readline with pdb when using doctest
          (see http://bugs.python.org/issue5727).
        
        - Made tests pass on Windows and Linux at the same time.
        
        
        3.7.4 (2009-05-01)
        ==================
        
        - Filenames of doctest examples now contain the line number and not
          only the example number. So a stack trace in pdb tells the exact
          line number of the current example. This fixes
          https://bugs.launchpad.net/bugs/339813
        
        - Colorization of doctest output correctly handles blank lines.
        
        
        3.7.3 (2009-04-22)
        ==================
        
        - Better deal with rogue threads by always exiting with status so even
          spinning daemon threads won't block the runner from exiting. This deprecated
          the ``--with-exit-status`` option.
        
        
        3.7.2 (2009-04-13)
        ==================
        
        - fix test failure on Python 2.4 because of slight difference in the way
          coverage is reported (__init__ files with only a single comment line are now
          not reported)
        - fixed bug that caused the test runner to hang when running subprocesses (as a
          result Python 2.3 is no longer supported).
        - there is apparently a bug in Python 2.6 (related to
          http://bugs.python.org/issue1303673) that causes the profile tests to fail.
        - added explanitory notes to buildout.cfg about how to run the tests with
          multiple versions of Python
        
        
        3.7.1 (2008-10-17)
        ==================
        
        - The setupstack temporary-directory support now properly handles
          read-only files by making them writable before removing them.
        
        
        3.7.0 (2008-09-22)
        ==================
        
        - Added an alterate setuptools / distutils commands for running all tests
          using our testrunner.  See 'zope.testing.testrunner.eggsupport:ftest'.
        
        - Added a setuptools-compatible test loader which skips tests with layers:
          the testrunner used by 'setup.py test' doesn't know about them, and those
          tests then fail.  See 'zope.testing.testrunner.eggsupport:SkipLayers'.
        
        - Added support for Jython, when a garbage collector call is sent.
        
        - Added support to bootstrap on Jython.
        
        - Fixed NameError in StartUpFailure.
        
        - Open doctest files in universal mode, so that packages released on Windows
          can be tested on Linux, for example.
        
        
        3.6.0 (2008/07/10)
        ==================
        
        - Added -j option to parallel tests run in subprocesses.
        
        - RENormalizer accepts plain Python callables.
        
        - Added --slow-test option.
        
        - Added --no-progress and --auto-progress options.
        
        - Complete refactoring of the test runner into multiple code files and a more
          modular (pipeline-like) architecture.
        
        - Unified unit tests with the layer support by introducing a real unit test
          layer.
        
        - Added a doctest for ``zope.testing.module``. There were several bugs
          that were fixed:
        
          * ``README.txt`` was a really bad default argument for the module
            name, as it is not a proper dotted name. The code would
            immediately fail as it would look for the ``txt`` module in the
            ``README`` package. The default is now ``__main__``.
        
          * The tearDown function did not clean up the ``__name__`` entry in the
            global dictionary.
        
        - Fix a bug that caused a SubprocessError to be generated if a subprocess
          sent any output to stderr.
        
        - Fix a bug that caused the unit tests to be skipped if run in a subprocess.
        
        
        3.5.1 (2007/08/14)
        ==================
        
        Bugs Fixed:
        -----------
        
        - Post-mortem debugging wasn't invoked for layer-setup failures.
        
        3.5.0 (2007/07/19)
        ==================
        
        New Features
        ------------
        
        - The test runner now works on Python 2.5.
        
        - Added support for cProfile.
        
        - Added output colorizing (-c option).
        
        - Added --hide-secondary-failures and --show-secondary-failures options
          (https://bugs.launchpad.net/zope3/+bug/115454).
        
        Bugs Fixed:
        -----------
        
        - Fix some problems with Unicode in doctests.
        
        - Fix "Error reading from subprocess" errors on Unix-like systems.
        
        3.4 (2007/03/29)
        ================
        
        New Features
        ------------
        
        - Added exit-with-status support (supports use with buildbot and
          zc.recipe.testing)
        
        - Added a small framework for automating set up and tear down of
          doctest tests. See setupstack.txt.
        
        Bugs Fixed:
        -----------
        
        - Fix testrunner-wo-source.txt and testrunner-errors.txt to run with a
          read-only source tree.
        
        3.0 (2006/09/20)
        ================
        
        - Updated the doctest copy with text-file encoding support.
        
        - Added logging-level support to loggingsuppport module.
        
        - At verbosity-level 1, dots are not output continuously, without any
          line breaks.
        
        - Improved output when the inability to tear down a layer causes tests
          to be run in a subprocess.
        
        - Made zope.exception required only if the zope_tracebacks extra is
          requested.
        
        2.x.y (???)
        ===========
        
        - Fix the test coverage. If a module, for example `interfaces`, was in an
          ignored directory/package, then if a module of the same name existed in a
          covered directory/package, then it was also ignored there, because the
          ignore cache stored the result by module name and not the filename of the
          module.
        
        2.0 (2006/01/05)
        ================
        
        - Corresponds to the version of the zope.testing package shipped as part of
          the Zope 3.2.0 release.
